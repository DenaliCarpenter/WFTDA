# WFTDA
# This project was done for the head of the Gender Women's and Sexuality Studies department at Grinnell College.
This project consisted of pulling all of the team names, locations, websites, and logos from the WFTDA website.
After pulling all of this information and reformatting it so it could be used, it was stored in a csv file.
The data was then used in an R Shiny app to make the information more easily accessible, digestible, and so forth.
